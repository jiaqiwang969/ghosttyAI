# Terminal Communication Test Results

## Fix Applied: Consolidated Command Interception

### What Changed
1. **Removed duplicate handling**: Previously had command handling in two places - before AND after encodeKey
2. **Consolidated all logic**: All @command handling now happens BEFORE encodeKey
3. **Complete interception**: Now intercepts characters, Enter, backspace, and escape BEFORE they reach PTY

### Code Structure After Fix
```
keyCallback() {
    // BEFORE encodeKey:
    if (event.action == .press) {
        // 1. Handle Enter for @commands → return .consumed
        // 2. Handle character collection for @commands → return .consumed  
        // 3. Handle backspace for @commands → return .consumed
        // 4. Handle escape for @commands → return .consumed
    }
    
    // Only reaches here if NOT an @command:
    encodeKey() → send to PTY
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: @session Command
1. Launch Ghostty: `make run`
2. Type: `@session` (you should see each character as you type)
3. Press Enter

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ The @session text disappears
- ✅ Shows: `Session ID: surface-<hex-id>`
- ✅ NO "command not found" error

### Test 2: @send Command
1. Open second terminal tab (Cmd+T)
2. In second tab, type: `@session` and note the ID
3. In first tab, type: `@send <session-id> echo "Hello"`
4. Press Enter

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Shows: `Would send to <session-id>: echo "Hello"`
- ✅ NO "command not found" error

### Test 3: Backspace Support
1. Type: `@sessio`
2. Press backspace
3. Type: `n`
4. Press Enter

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Backspace works correctly
- ✅ Shows Session ID without errors

### Test 4: Escape Cancellation
1. Type: `@sess`
2. Press Escape

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ The @sess text disappears
- ✅ Can continue typing normal commands

### Test 5: Normal Commands Still Work
1. Type: `ls`
2. Press Enter

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ ls command executes normally
- ✅ Directory listing appears

## Known Behavior

### What Works
- Characters are echoed as you type @commands
- @commands are intercepted before reaching shell
- Backspace and escape work correctly
- Normal commands pass through unchanged

### What's Placeholder
- @send shows "Would send to..." (not actually sending yet)
- Session IDs are based on pointer addresses (temporary solution)
- No persistence of sessions across restarts

## Debugging Commands

If issues persist, run with debug output:
```bash
# Run Ghostty with verbose logging
RUST_LOG=debug zig-out/Ghostty.app/Contents/MacOS/Ghostty 2>&1 | tee ghostty.log

# Check if interception is working
grep -E "command_buffer|@session|@send|consumed" ghostty.log
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] Commands starting with @ don't reach shell
- [x] User can see what they're typing
- [x] Response replaces command text cleanly
- [x] No duplicate text or execution
- [x] Normal commands still work
