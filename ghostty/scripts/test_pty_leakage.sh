# PTY Leakage Test Script
# This script helps verify that @commands don't leak to PTY

echo "=== Ghostty Terminal Communication PTY Leakage Test ==="
echo
echo "Instructions:"
echo "1. First, run 'cat -v' in a new Ghostty terminal"
echo "2. Then try typing '@session' and press Enter"
echo "3. If fix works: cat -v should NOT show any '@session' characters"
echo "4. You should only see 'Session ID: ...' displayed on screen"
echo "5. Press Ctrl+C to exit cat -v when done"
echo
echo "Expected Results After Fix:"
echo "✅ No '@session' characters visible in cat -v output"
echo "✅ No 'Session ID: ...' characters visible in cat -v output"  
echo "✅ Session ID appears on screen but not in PTY stream"
echo "✅ No shell 'command not found' errors"
echo
echo "If you see '@session' or 'Session ID:' in cat -v output, the fix needs more work."
echo
echo "Test Commands:"
echo "cat -v                    # Monitor PTY input"
echo "@session                  # Test command (should not appear in cat -v)"
echo "@send target123 echo hi   # Test command (should not appear in cat -v)"
