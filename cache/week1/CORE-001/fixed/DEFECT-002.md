# DEFECT-002: Interface Naming Inconsistency Resolution

**Defect ID**: DEFECT-002  
**Priority**: P0 - Integration Blocker  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Fix Version**: 1.1.0  
**Fixed By**: CORE-001 (c-tmux-specialist)  
**Date Fixed**: 2025-08-25  
**Delivery Time**: Before 23:00 deadline  

## Defect Description

Interface naming inconsistency between CORE-001 and CORE-002 implementations was blocking integration. The function naming convention was not standardized:

- CORE-001 originally used mixed naming (`tty_hooks_init` internally but could be confused with `tty_write_hooks_init`)
- CORE-002's backend_router.c expected standardized `tty_hooks_*` names
- This mismatch would cause linking errors during integration

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Initial Design**: Original implementation focused on "write hooks" specific naming
2. **Evolution**: As the interface evolved, it became clear these were general TTY hooks, not just write operations
3. **Communication Gap**: Standardization requirement not clearly communicated between teams
4. **Discovery**: Issue found during CORE-002's backend_router.c implementation

## Fix Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Standardized all function names to `tty_hooks_*` pattern**:
   - `tty_hooks_init()` - Confirmed as standard
   - `tty_hooks_install()` - Confirmed as standard
   - `tty_hooks_uninstall()` - Confirmed as standard
   - `tty_hooks_get_stats()` - Confirmed as standard
   - `tty_hooks_reset_stats()` - Confirmed as standard

2. **Added backward compatibility macros**:
   ```c
   #define tty_write_hooks_init() tty_hooks_init()
   // ... other compatibility macros
   ```

3. **Version bumped to 1.1.0** in all files

4. **Created compatibility test suite** to verify both interfaces work

### Files Modified

```
cache/week1/CORE-001/fixed/
├── tty_write_hooks.h       # Added compatibility macros, v1.1.0
├── tty_write_hooks.c       # Version update to v1.1.0
├── test_compatibility.c    # New compatibility test
├── tests/
│   └── test_tty_write_hooks.c  # Version update to v1.1.0
├── MIGRATION_GUIDE.md      # New migration documentation
└── DEFECT-002.md          # This report
```

## Testing Performed

### Unit Tests
✅ All 7 original tests pass  
✅ New compatibility test passes  
✅ Both old and new function names work  

### Integration Tests
✅ Verified `#include "tty_write_hooks.h"` works with backend_router.c  
✅ Verified `tty_hooks_init()` is accessible  
✅ Verified no symbol conflicts  

### Backward Compatibility Tests
✅ Old names still work via macros  
✅ No breaking changes for existing code  
✅ Can disable compatibility with `TTY_HOOKS_NO_COMPAT`  

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact
- ✅ Unblocks CORE-002 integration
- ✅ Standardizes interface for all teams
- ✅ Future-proof naming convention
- ✅ Maintains full backward compatibility

### No Negative Impact
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ No functionality changes
- ✅ Seamless migration path

## Verification Steps

1. **Build the fixed version**:
   ```bash
   cd cache/week1/CORE-001/fixed
   make clean && make all
   ```

2. **Run compatibility test**:
   ```bash
   gcc -o test_compat test_compatibility.c -I.
   ./test_compat
   ```

3. **Run full test suite**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. **Verify with backend_router.c**:
   ```bash
   cd ../CORE-002
   gcc -c backend_router.c -I../CORE-001/fixed -I../ARCH-001
   # Should compile without errors
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Early Integration Testing**: Should test interfaces between components earlier
2. **Naming Standards**: Establish naming conventions in design phase
3. **Cross-Team Communication**: Regular sync on interface definitions
4. **Compatibility Strategy**: Always provide migration path for interface changes

## Preventive Measures

1. **Interface Design Review**: All interfaces reviewed by architect before implementation
2. **Integration Tests**: Add automated tests for cross-component interfaces
3. **Naming Guidelines**: Document standard naming patterns in project wiki
4. **Version Control**: Use semantic versioning for interface changes

## Sign-off

**Fixed By**: CORE-001 (c-tmux-specialist)  
**Verified By**: Pending PM validation  
**Integration Ready**: ✅ YES  

## Appendix: Quick Fix Verification

```bash
# Quick command to verify the fix
cd /Users/jqwang/98-ghosttyAI/cache/week1/CORE-001/fixed
grep -n "void tty_hooks_init" tty_write_hooks.h tty_write_hooks.c
# Should show the standardized function names
```

**Resolution Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for integration
