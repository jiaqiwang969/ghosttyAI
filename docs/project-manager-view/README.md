# Architecture v0.1 - Ghostty × tmux Integration
## Task-Driven Architecture with Clear Ownership

### Overview
This directory contains the enhanced architecture documentation for the Ghostty × tmux (libtmuxcore) integration project, with a focus on **clear task ownership** and **personnel accountability**.

### Key Improvements from v0.0
1. **Clear Personnel Assignments**: Every task has a specific owner
2. **Role-Based Views**: Each engineer knows exactly what they need to do
3. **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable outcomes for each task
4. **Complete Traceability**: From architecture to individual tasks

### Directory Contents

#### Team Organization
- `team-structure.md` - Complete team hierarchy and RACI matrix
- `task-assignment-matrix.md` - Detailed task assignments per engineer

#### Task Management Diagrams
- `task-ownership-week1.puml` - Week 1 detailed task cards with owners
- `task-complete-ownership.puml` - All 5 weeks overview with dependencies
- `role-swimlanes.puml` - Each engineer's complete task list
- `ownership-gantt.puml` - Timeline view with clear accountability

#### Architecture Ownership
- `component-ownership.puml` - Which person owns which components

#### Critical Path
```
T-101 (CORE-001) → T-103 (CORE-002) → T-201 (CORE-001) → 
T-301 (INTG-001) → T-401 (QA-001) → T-504 (QA-001)
```

#### Week-by-Week Focus
- **Week 1**: UI Backend Foundation (Led by CORE-001)
- **Week 2**: Event Loop & Callbacks (Led by CORE-001)
- **Week 3**: Zig FFI Bridge (Led by INTG-001)
- **Week 4**: Testing & Performance (Led by QA-001)
- **Week 5**: Release Preparation (Led by OPS-001)

### How to Use This Documentation

#### For Project Managers
1. Use `task-assignment-matrix.md` to track individual assignments
2. Monitor `ownership-gantt.puml` for timeline progress
3. Check `team-structure.md` for escalation paths

#### For Engineers
1. Find your tasks in `role-swimlanes.puml`
2. Check dependencies in `task-complete-ownership.puml`
3. Understand your components in `component-ownership.puml`

#### For Architects
1. Review all design decisions in component diagrams
2. Approve changes based on `component-ownership.puml`
3. Validate integration points

### Generating Diagrams

To generate SVG files from PlantUML:
```bash
cd /Users/jqwang/98-ghosttyAI/docs/architecture-v0.1
make all  # Generates all SVG files
```

Or individually:
```bash
plantuml -tsvg task-ownership-week1.puml
plantuml -tsvg task-complete-ownership.puml
plantuml -tsvg role-swimlanes.puml
plantuml -tsvg ownership-gantt.puml
plantuml -tsvg component-ownership.puml
```

### Success Metrics

#### Accountability Metrics
- Every task has ONE owner (no shared ownership)
- Every component has ONE maintainer
- Every decision has ONE approver

#### Delivery Metrics
- 90% task completion rate per sprint
- 100% acceptance criteria verification
- <10 minute blocker resolution
- Every 30 minutes code commit

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Project Manager assigns engineers to roles
   - Each engineer reviews their task list
   - ARCH-001 approves the architecture

2. **Week 1 Start**:
   - CORE-001 begins T-101 (tty_write extraction)
   - ARCH-001 completes T-102 (UI backend design)
   - QA-001 creates test plan

3. **Daily Operations**:
   - 9am standup with status updates
   - Task owners update status in diagrams
   - Blockers escalated within 10 minutes
