**Status**: FIXED  
**Priority**: P0 - Integration Blocker RESOLVED  
**Delivered**: 2025-08-25 (Before 23:00 deadline)  
**Location**: `/Users/jqwang/98-ghosttyAI/cache/week1/CORE-001/fixed/`  

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Interface naming inconsistency blocking CORE-002 integration
- Function names not standardized between components

### Solution Implemented
1. ✅ **Standardized all functions to `tty_hooks_*` naming**
2. ✅ **Added backward compatibility macros for smooth transition**
3. ✅ **Updated version to 1.1.0 across all files**
4. ✅ **Created comprehensive documentation**

## ✅ Verification Results

### Interface Compatibility
- ✅ `tty_hooks_init()` - Standardized name works
- ✅ `tty_hooks_install()` - Standardized name works
- ✅ `tty_hooks_uninstall()` - Standardized name works
- ✅ `tty_write_hooks_*` - Old names work via compatibility macros

### Integration Testing
- ✅ Compatible with CORE-002's backend_router.c
- ✅ No breaking changes for existing code
- ✅ Seamless migration path provided

## 🚀 Integration Instructions

### For CORE-002 Team
```bash
# Use the fixed version
cd /Users/jqwang/98-ghosttyAI/cache/week1/CORE-002
gcc -c backend_router.c -I../CORE-001/fixed -I../ARCH-001
# Will compile without errors
```

### For Other Teams
```c
// Continue using old names during transition
#include "tty_write_hooks.h"
tty_write_hooks_init();  // Works via compatibility macro

// Or migrate to new names (recommended)
tty_hooks_init();  // Direct call to standardized name
```

## 📊 Impact

- **Unblocks**: CORE-002 integration can proceed immediately
- **No Breaking Changes**: Full backward compatibility maintained
- **Future-Proof**: Standardized naming for all future development

## 🎯 Key Achievement

**Delivered P0 fix in < 2 hours** with:
- Zero breaking changes
- Full backward compatibility
- Complete documentation
- Verified integration readiness
